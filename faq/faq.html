            <b>What is VMOS?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            VMOS is an APP software based on Virtual Machine (VM). <br/>VMOS can be installed in the form of a normal APP to Linux or Android system through VM technology. <br/>That is to run another complete Android system through an application.<br/>Moreover, VMOS is not controlled by the host system. (Android on the phone).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>Does VMOS run in the cloud?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            VMOS is running locally, including the memory (RAM) consumed by the runtime and the storage space (ROM) consumption.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>What is the difference between VMOS and cloud phones?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            <p>The biggest difference between VMOS and cloud mobile phones lies in resource consumption. <br/>All the performance parameters of cloud mobile phones are derived from the merchants, you can only change the internet speed. <br/>However, VMOS is completely depended on the performance of the real machine.</p>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>What are the requirements for VMOS operation?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            Because VMOS is a virtual system, the size of the system is difficult to reduce. <br/>So at least 2gb (RAM) + 2gb (ROM) free space is required to enter VMOS, and 3gb ram + 32gb rom or higher mobile phones are recommended.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>Why does VMOS ask so many permissions?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            we are asking all these permissions for better simulation of a real phone.<br/>VMOS is a system can install Apps, we are asking specific permissions to make sure users can use apps that need those specific permissions. (Android 5.1 ask all permissions before you download apps)<br/>1. Floating window permission: For better playing the virtual machine on the real machine interface.<br/>2. Storage permissions: Because the data in the virtual machine is empty, considering that you need to transfer the local file. This permission will only be used for the file transfer station.<br/>3. Recording permission: This permission will only be used when you use voice transmission or call.<br/>4. Camera Permissions: This permission will only be used when you use the camera, such as scanning QR code, taking photos, and video calling.<br/>5. Device information: Because the device information of VMOS is originally empty, you need to obtain the device information of the real machine to make the device information of the virtual machine the same. There is sensitive information in these data, but we do not upload and collect data.<br/>6. Telephone rights: The device information such as IMEI of some mobile phones is permission.

          <span>
            <b>What data does VMOS collect?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            For better user experiences, we collect your phone model and the error log.

            <b>Why I can&#39;t see the floating ball?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            The floating ball needs to be granted permission by the real system.

        </div>
  <div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>Why does the floating ball change color?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
            The color of the floating ball is to better distinguish whether it is in the real machine or in the virtual machine.<br/>Blue: In the virtual machine.<br/>Green: The real machine.

<div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>What is the floating window?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
          The floating window can change VMOS&#39;s picture into a small window, similar to the application window on PC.<br/>It can be freely zoomed and dragged.<br/>You can also realize the simultaneous operation of the real machine and the virtual machine.

            <b>How to run the apps in the background?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
          After running the application, click &quot;Return&quot; in the floating ball, or press HOME in the real machine.
          </p>
        </div>
<div class="faq-q">
          <span>
            <b>Why does the background run App drop, kill, black screen, or reboot, etc.?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
        1. The phone&#39;s memory is exhausted and is killed by the system.<br/>For example, the virtual machine opened a game, the real machine also ran the game. One of these two will be killed if the storage is insufficient.<br/>2. The battery optimization&#39;s been added, the system automatically detects high power consumption.<br/> Then the system kills the process by default.<br/> It would be solved by adding a whitelist to the battery optimization of the real machine settings.
