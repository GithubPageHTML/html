            <b>What is the function of RAM in an Android Phone?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
First, the name. You don't really need to know that "RAM" stands for "random access memory." But what you do need to know is that RAM is a super-fast type of storage — faster than your phone's main storage where your apps, photos, videos, and music live — and it helps your smartphone work and feel fast.<br>

Here's how RAM works and what it does in your smartphone:
<br>
• You can think of RAM as your pocket and your phone's main storage as your backpack. It's much faster to pull something out of your pocket than it is to pull something out from your backpack.<br>
• When you turn on your phone, and open an app for the first time, your phone pulls the operating system (OS) and app's data from your phone's slower main storage and stores the bulk of that OS and app data in your phone's faster RAM so you can use different elements and features of the OS and app quickly.<br>
• When you're finished with the app you're using, your phone keeps the app and whatever you were doing on it in your phone's RAM, even if you switch to another app.<br>
• When you return to an app you used a while ago, it'll open right where you left off, as if you never even left the app, because it's been stored in your phone's RAM. Essentially, apps you used are kept running in the background while you use other apps.<br>
• Switching between apps and picking up right where you left off is often called "multitasking." If a phone is said to multitask well, it's because it makes good use of RAM or simply has a ton of it.<br>
• If a phone didn't have RAM, apps would fully close whenever you switch apps. That means apps would need to fully re-open, as if you opened them for the first time after turning on your phone, which causes a delay before you can use the app.<br>
• Your phone's main slower storage could potentially keep your OS and used apps running in the background, but it's much, much slower than RAM. • Your phone could have the fastest chip in the world and it would still feel slow without RAM.<br>

So, yes, more RAM is generally better, but it's not that  simple
<br>
Indeed, more RAM means your phone can store more of the OS data and apps you often use for quick access. It gives off the impression that your phone is incredibly fast because the OS and apps you've previously used are ready to use straight away when you return to them.<br>
You want fix lag = empty your app in background {ram memory}

          <span>
            <b>Error and force stop?</b>
          </span>
          <p>
          Most of the errors that occur within vmos are the result of using modified roms or cracked version apk, which often contain many and unstable errors.<br>
Therefore, reporting these mistakes causes our confusion and wastes time, nothing more, whoever reports any error and is found to be using modified versions or ROMs will be excluded from the group
Only use the official roms :)

          </span>
          <p>
          For a clear statement about the problem of playing videos, displaying PDF files and other things<br>
The VMOS app doesn't come with all pre-installed programs to run everything.<br>
You need third-party tools<br>
If you want to play the video, you must install the video player<br>
If you want to view a PDF, you need to install the PDF Reader

1. Force stop the application<br>
2. Clear the cache memory<br>

          </span>
          <p>
         With the constant updates of the Android system, applications need to be granted permissions and this cannot be done automatically<br>
So go to
1. settings android >> search on VMOS app >> enable all permissions<br>
2. Go to VM settings or Settings from the floating window >> Authority management >> enable all sensors there

          </span>
          <p>
            It appears to be an issue with Google's Android operating system.To fixthe“your device is not compatible with this version” error message, try<br>
1. Restart Your Device<br>
2. Go To Settings > Apps > Google Play Store > Storage > Clear data<br>
If this method does not work, Incompatibility does not necessarily mean that your Android device has some technical problems. There may be some problems set by the application developer, such as geo-restrictions. Some applications are launched for particular countries. In case you live in a different country where the app hasn’t been launched, then you might face incompatibility error.
